# lib/detect-root.sh — worktree-aware workspace-root detection (sourced helper)
# =============================================================================
# Shared by karpathy-consistency-check.sh and the multi-project ROOT
# completion-checker.sh so the root-resolution logic is defined ONCE and cannot
# drift independently between the two oracles.
#
# Usage (from a script in scripts/meta/):
#   SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
#   . "$SCRIPT_DIR/lib/detect-root.sh"
#   ROOT="$(detect_root "${1:-}")"
#
# Resolution order:
#   1. explicit $1 argument            (skipped if a transient worktree path)
#   2. $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR             (skipped if a transient worktree path)
#   3. git --git-common-dir           (a linked worktree resolves to real ROOT)
#   4. git --show-toplevel
#   5. three levels up from this lib   (scripts/meta/lib -> ROOT)
#
# Why the worktree guard: a transient worktree under .../.claude/worktrees/<name>
# is a checkout of ROOT itself, not a receiver. Callers exclude
# '*/.claude/worktrees/*' from their find enumerators; if ROOT resolved to a
# worktree path that exclusion would empty the file list (false FAIL) and block
# every commit made from inside a worktree. Rejecting worktree paths from (1)/(2)
# lets (3) resolve the real workspace root. NOTE: the ROOT completion-checker
# passes its own ROOT_DIR as $1, so BOTH the arg and env branches must be guarded.
#
# This file is meant to be SOURCED (no side effects beyond defining detect_root
# and one namespaced variable); it deliberately does not set shell options so it
# inherits the caller's `set` flags.
